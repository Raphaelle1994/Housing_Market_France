/* Cleaning and formating data

First, having a look at what our data looks like

SELECT *

/*The dataset has some limitations : libelle_geo contains departments, cities and towns

 - code_parent contains different scales such as nation and department codes
 - NULL values are present

I used data from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/statistiques-dvf/

Some outliers have been kept by the government agencies except for extremes to stay true to the realities of the market, so I am not going to remove more of them

It is explained that the data shows the same sale several times on different scales (example one house sold will be prepresented on the city scale, council scale and french scale). 

 FIRST STEP:

 The scale I want is department, and I want one sale to be one entry (no duplicates)
 I am also only interested in houses 
 I want the column names to be in english
